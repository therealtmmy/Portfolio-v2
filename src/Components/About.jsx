        Hello there, I'm Timmi, a passionate front-end developer with a
        background in graphics design. My journey into programming began when my
        passion for learning ignited, leading me to explore front-end
        development as my area of focus, leveraging my previous experience in
        the design industry. I thrive on continuous learning and love exercising
        my creativity, whether working independently or collaborating within a
        team. Problem-solving is my forte, making front-end development a
        perfect fit for me.

        I find satisfaction in seamlessly integrating APIs with user interfaces,
        enhancing functionality and user experience. In addition to my design
        background, I have hands-on experience with Adobe Photoshop and have
        also ventured into entrepreneurship in the tech space. I am genuinely
        excited about what the future holds and fully committed to delivering my
        best within any company I join.
